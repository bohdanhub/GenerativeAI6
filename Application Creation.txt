Generate python code for aws lambda function to collect metrics from from the number and overall size of unattached disk volumes, not encrypted disk volumes, and not encrypted snapshots.
Use boto3 library, python 3.9 and give instruction how to install it to aws lambda.
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a sample Lambda function that uses the boto3 library to collect metrics about:

The number and overall size of unattached disk volumes.
Not encrypted disk volumes.
Not encrypted snapshots.
python
Copy code
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

    # 1. Unattached disk volumes
    unattached_volumes = ec2.describe_volumes(
        Filters=[
            {
                'Name': 'status',
                'Values': ['available']
            }
        ]
    )['Volumes']

    num_unattached_volumes = len(unattached_volumes)
    total_size_unattached_volumes = sum([vol['Size'] for vol in unattached_volumes])

    # 2. Not encrypted disk volumes
    not_encrypted_volumes = ec2.describe_volumes(
        Filters=[
            {
                'Name': 'encrypted',
                'Values': ['false']
            }
        ]
    )['Volumes']

    num_not_encrypted_volumes = len(not_encrypted_volumes)

    # 3. Not encrypted snapshots
    not_encrypted_snapshots = ec2.describe_snapshots(
        Filters=[
            {
                'Name': 'encrypted',
                'Values': ['false']
            }
        ],
        OwnerIds=['self']  # to get snapshots owned by your account
    )['Snapshots']

    num_not_encrypted_snapshots = len(not_encrypted_snapshots)

    return {
        'num_unattached_volumes': num_unattached_volumes,
        'total_size_unattached_volumes': total_size_unattached_volumes,
        'num_not_encrypted_volumes': num_not_encrypted_volumes,
        'num_not_encrypted_snapshots': num_not_encrypted_snapshots
    }
Instructions to Deploy the Lambda function:

Setting up the Environment:

Make sure you have AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate permissions.
Make sure you have boto3 installed: pip install boto3.
IAM Role for Lambda:

In the AWS Management Console, navigate to IAM.
Create a new Role for Lambda. Attach the AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess permission policy. This allows the Lambda function to describe EC2 volumes and snapshots.
Packaging and Deployment:

Zip the function:

bash
Copy code
zip lambda_function.zip lambda_function.py
Create or update the lambda function:

bash
Copy code
aws lambda create-function --function-name CollectEC2Metrics --runtime python3.9 --role arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:role/YOUR_IAM_ROLE_FOR_LAMBDA --handler lambda_function.lambda_handler --zip-file fileb://lambda_function.zip
If updating an existing function, use update-function-code:

bash
Copy code
aws lambda update-function-code --function-name CollectEC2Metrics --zip-file fileb://lambda_function.zip
Test the Function:

In the AWS Management Console, navigate to Lambda.
Select the function you just created, and click the Test button. Create a new test event (the event content doesn't matter as it's not used in this function).
Click Test to execute. The function should return the metrics.
Remember to always adhere to AWS best practices, secure your functions, and apply the principle of least privilege when assigning IAM roles and permissions.

Update code to store results to s3 bucket named "bkukl-s3". Also describe IAM policies that need for lambda.
ChatGPT
To store results in an S3 bucket, the Lambda function needs permission to write to the specified bucket. Here's an updated version of the code:

python
Copy code
import boto3
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    bucket_name = 'bkukl-s3'
    
    # 1. Unattached disk volumes
    unattached_volumes = ec2.describe_volumes(
        Filters=[
            {
                'Name': 'status',
                'Values': ['available']
            }
        ]
    )['Volumes']

    num_unattached_volumes = len(unattached_volumes)
    total_size_unattached_volumes = sum([vol['Size'] for vol in unattached_volumes])

    # 2. Not encrypted disk volumes
    not_encrypted_volumes = ec2.describe_volumes(
        Filters=[
            {
                'Name': 'encrypted',
                'Values': ['false']
            }
        ]
    )['Volumes']

    num_not_encrypted_volumes = len(not_encrypted_volumes)

    # 3. Not encrypted snapshots
    not_encrypted_snapshots = ec2.describe_snapshots(
        Filters=[
            {
                'Name': 'encrypted',
                'Values': ['false']
            }
        ],
        OwnerIds=['self']
    )['Snapshots']

    num_not_encrypted_snapshots = len(not_encrypted_snapshots)

    results = {
        'num_unattached_volumes': num_unattached_volumes,
        'total_size_unattached_volumes': total_size_unattached_volumes,
        'num_not_encrypted_volumes': num_not_encrypted_volumes,
        'num_not_encrypted_snapshots': num_not_encrypted_snapshots
    }
    
    # Store results to S3
    s3.put_object(
        Bucket=bucket_name,
        Key='ec2_metrics.json',
        Body=json.dumps(results),
        ContentType='application/json'
    )

    return results
IAM Policies for Lambda:

AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess: This AWS managed policy allows the function to describe EC2 volumes and snapshots.

Custom S3 Write Policy:

json
Copy code
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "WriteToSpecifiedBucket",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bkukl-s3/*"
        }
    ]
}
This policy provides permissions to write objects into the specified S3 bucket.

Instructions:

Create an IAM role for Lambda. Attach the AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess AWS managed policy and the custom S3 write policy to this role.

Follow the previously provided instructions to package and deploy the Lambda function.

Make sure the bucket bkukl-s3 exists. If not, create it.

By adhering to these steps, your Lambda function will have permissions to describe EC2 metrics and store the results in an S3 bucket.

How to download boto3 to folder? 
ChatGPT
To download the boto3 library and its dependencies into a specific folder, you can use the pip command. Here's how you can do it:

First, navigate to the folder where you want to download the library:
bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/your/folder
Next, use pip to install the boto3 library and its dependencies to that folder:
bash
Copy code
pip install boto3 -t .
The -t option in pip specifies the target directory. By using . (which represents the current directory in Unix-like systems), you're telling pip to install the library in the current folder.

After running these commands, you should see the boto3 library along with its dependencies in your specified folder.

Note: If you're preparing a package for AWS Lambda, you'd often do this to include the required libraries in the same package as your function code.




User
in bucket polissy missing principal
ChatGPT
You're right; the provided policy does not specify the Principal. The Principal element in the policy determines who is allowed to access the resource.

If your goal is to grant the Lambda function permissions, and that Lambda function assumes a specific IAM role when it's executed, then you'd specify that role's ARN as the principal.

Here's the updated policy with the Principal field:

json
Copy code
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "WriteToSpecifiedBucket",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:role/YOUR_LAMBDA_ROLE_NAME"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bkukl-s3/*"
        }
    ]
}
Replace YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID with your actual AWS account ID and YOUR_LAMBDA_ROLE_NAME with the IAM role that your Lambda function assumes.

However, please note that if you're attaching this policy directly to the IAM role that the Lambda function is assuming, you don't need to specify the Principal in your policy. The act of attaching the policy to a role inherently grants that role the permissions in the policy. The Principal is more commonly used in resource-based policies like an S3 bucket policy, for example, where you're defining who can access that resource.




User
console return error: "Invalid principal in policy"
ChatGPT
I apologize for the oversight. Let's correct this.

The error "Invalid principal in policy" typically arises when specifying a Principal in a policy that's meant to be attached to an IAM Role. In IAM Role-based policies (those you attach directly to roles, users, or groups), you don't need to specify a Principal since the association with the role or user implies the principal.

If you're creating an S3 Bucket Policy (a resource-based policy), then the Principal would be relevant.

Here's how you'd define it in the context of an S3 Bucket Policy:

json
Copy code
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "WriteToSpecifiedBucket",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID:role/YOUR_LAMBDA_ROLE_NAME"
            },
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bkukl-s3/*"
        }
    ]
}
In this context, the policy says, "Allow the specified IAM role to put objects in the specified S3 bucket."

However, if you're creating an IAM Role policy (to attach directly to the role), remove the Principal:

json
Copy code
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "WriteToSpecifiedBucket",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bkukl-s3/*"
        }
    ]
}
To recap:

If you're trying to attach a policy directly to a Lambda IAM role, don't use the Principal.

If you're trying to set an S3 Bucket Policy, use the Principal to specify which IAM roles, users, or AWS accounts are allowed the given permissions.




User
full size with boto3 librery more than 10 mb. How to install boto3 with less size?
ChatGPT
The boto3 library, when combined with its dependency botocore, can indeed exceed the Lambda deployment package limit when bundled directly. However, there are a few strategies to address this:

Use Lambda Layers: AWS Lambda allows you to use layers to manage code and dependencies separately from your function. You can put the boto3 library in a separate layer and attach that layer to your Lambda function. This way, the size of your function deployment package remains small, and you can use layers to manage larger dependencies. Remember, Lambda allows multiple layers, and the total unzipped size, including all layers, should remain within the limit.

Slim Down the Boto3 Library:

Instead of installing the entire boto3 library, you can just install the necessary parts of botocore which is the underlying library that boto3 uses. This involves a bit more work and might not be feasible for all use cases but can significantly reduce the size.
Use tools like lambda-packages (found on GitHub) which provide precompiled popular Python libraries, including boto3, specifically for use in AWS Lambda. This can be smaller than a typical pip installation.
Use Older Versions: Sometimes, older versions of boto3 or botocore might be smaller. This is not the most recommended method as you'll be missing out on updates, bug fixes, and potential new features. However, it's an option to consider if you need to quickly deploy and are sure the older version provides what you need.

Opt for Other AWS SDKs: If you're open to changing languages, some SDKs might be smaller than the Python SDK. For example, the JavaScript SDK (aws-sdk) might be smaller, especially if you're using only specific services.

To try to slim down boto3, here's a simplified method:

Navigate to the directory where you're preparing your Lambda package.
Install only boto3 and botocore without their dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install boto3 botocore --no-deps -t .
Now, manually copy only the necessary service models from botocore. This step depends on what services you're interacting with. For example, if you're only working with EC2 and S3, you can only copy those. The service models are located in the botocore/data directory.
Remember, by manually tampering with libraries, you might encounter unexpected issues. Always test your function thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected.

Change python script to collect overall size from each unattached volumes and encrypted volumes, and  not encrypted snapshots.
ChatGPT
To update the script to collect the overall size from each of the unattached volumes, encrypted volumes, and non-encrypted snapshots, we need to make modifications to the previous code. Here's the updated Python script:

python
Copy code
import boto3
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    bucket_name = 'bkukl-s3'
    
    # 1. Overall size of unattached disk volumes
    unattached_volumes = ec2.describe_volumes(
        Filters=[
            {
                'Name': 'status',
                'Values': ['available']
            }
        ]
    )['Volumes']
    total_size_unattached_volumes = sum([vol['Size'] for vol in unattached_volumes])

    # 2. Overall size of encrypted disk volumes
    encrypted_volumes = ec2.describe_volumes(
        Filters=[
            {
                'Name': 'encrypted',
                'Values': ['true']
            }
        ]
    )['Volumes']
    total_size_encrypted_volumes = sum([vol['Size'] for vol in encrypted_volumes])

    # 3. Not encrypted snapshots
    not_encrypted_snapshots = ec2.describe_snapshots(
        Filters=[
            {
                'Name': 'encrypted',
                'Values': ['false']
            }
        ],
        OwnerIds=['self']
    )['Snapshots']
    total_size_not_encrypted_snapshots = sum([snap['VolumeSize'] for snap in not_encrypted_snapshots])

    results = {
        'total_size_unattached_volumes': total_size_unattached_volumes,
        'total_size_encrypted_volumes': total_size_encrypted_volumes,
        'total_size_not_encrypted_snapshots': total_size_not_encrypted_snapshots
    }
    
    # Store results to S3
    s3.put_object(
        Bucket=bucket_name,
        Key='ec2_metrics.json',
        Body=json.dumps(results),
        ContentType='application/json'
    )

    return results
This code modification will now correctly gather the overall size of each unattached volume, encrypted volume, and non-encrypted snapshot, then store the results in the bkukl-s3 S3 bucket. Ensure that the necessary permissions are in place for the Lambda function to access EC2 resources and write to the S3 bucket.




User
Generete lifecycle policies for s3 bucket.
ChatGPT
AWS S3 bucket lifecycle policies help manage your objects so they can be transitioned to less expensive storage classes or archived/deleted. The specific policy you'd use depends on your needs, but I'll provide a few common examples:

Transition objects to Glacier after 30 days:
Transition objects from the STANDARD storage class to the GLACIER storage class 30 days after the object's creation date.

Transition objects to Intelligent-Tiering after 30 days:
Transition objects to the INTELLIGENT_TIERING storage class after 30 days if the storage pattern is unknown or if it changes.

Delete objects after 365 days:
Permanently delete objects 365 days after the object's creation date.

Here's how you'd define these policies in JSON format:

json
Copy code
{
    "Rules": [
        {
            "ID": "MoveToGlacier",
            "Status": "Enabled",
            "Prefix": "",
            "Transitions": [
                {
                    "Date": "2023-08-09T00:00:00.000Z",
                    "StorageClass": "GLACIER"
                }
            ],
            "Expiration": {
                "Days": 365
            }
        },
        {
            "ID": "MoveToIntelligentTiering",
            "Status": "Enabled",
            "Prefix": "logs/",
            "Transitions": [
                {
                    "Days": 30,
                    "StorageClass": "INTELLIGENT_TIERING"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "ID": "DeleteOldObjects",
            "Status": "Enabled",
            "Prefix": "old/",
            "Expiration": {
                "Days": 365
            }
        }
    ]
}
Here's a breakdown of the above policies:

The MoveToGlacier rule transitions all objects (empty prefix implies all objects) in the bucket to the GLACIER storage class after 30 days and deletes them after 365 days.
The MoveToIntelligentTiering rule transitions objects in the "logs/" folder of the bucket to the INTELLIGENT_TIERING storage class after 30 days.
The DeleteOldObjects rule deletes objects in the "old/" folder of the bucket after 365 days.
You can apply this policy to an S3 bucket using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, SDKs, or AWS CloudFormation.

Make sure to adapt the policy according to your specific requirements, such as the prefixes (which can target specific "folders" or file types in your S3 bucket), transition dates, or expiration times.
